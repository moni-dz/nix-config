 sway-borders is a fork of [Sway](https://swaywm.org), an [i3](https://i3wm.org/)-compatible [Wayland](http://wayland.freedesktop.org/) compositor. It introduces some new features like more customizable borders, but is otherwise kept up to date with [sway](https://github.com/swaywm/sway).
 
 Please refer to the [Sway GitHub](https://github.com/swaywm/sway/) for docs and related material which isn't related to the new features below.

 # Features
  - [X] Border images (allow for drop shadows, outer curved borders, etc.)
  - [ ] Curved borders (inner)
+ - [ ] Blur
+ - And more, see [sway#3380](https://github.com/swaywm/sway/issues/3380)
  
 Descriptions and usage of the features can be found below. If you would like some more features that won't be added by Sway, feel free to request them for this project instead.
 
 ## Border Images
 This feature allows the use of eight images that get snapped on to the corners and edges of windows. This allows for any combination of outer curved borders, drop shadows, and multi-layer borders. These border images are drawn wherever gaps normally appear.

 Unlike pixel borders, the border images will overflow into gaps, so you may have to alter your gaps to accomidate.
 
 To use this in your config, you would probably use the following:
 ```
-exec_always border-images.focused /some/folder
-exec_always border-images.focused_inactive /some/folder
-exec_always border-images.unfocused /some/folder
-exec_always border-images.urgent /some/folder
+exec_always border-images.focused /some/folder/
+exec_always border-images.focused_inactive /some/folder/
+exec_always border-images.unfocused /some/folder/
+exec_always border-images.urgent /some/folder/
 ```
->>>>>>> d78dc512 (Add initial README and docs)
 
 **Note**: A folder which doesn't contain any images, or only contains some of the images will not throw any errors or warnings, do double check your folder path if you experience issues.
 
 ### Samples
 The [`/contrib/borders/` folder](https://github.com/TheAvidDev/sway-borders/tree/master/contrib/borders/) contains some example and community contributed border images, alongside screenshots. Feel free to add your own and make a PR!
 
-<<<<<<< HEAD
-## Configuration
-
-If you already use i3, then copy your i3 config to `~/.config/sway/config` and
-it'll work out of the box. Otherwise, copy the sample configuration file to
-`~/.config/sway/config`. It is usually located at `/etc/sway/config`.
-Run `man 5 sway` for information on the configuration.
-
-## Running
-
-Run `sway` from a TTY. Some display managers may work but are not supported by
-sway (gdm is known to work fairly well).

 ## Rounded Borders
 While the border images allow for rounded borders to be added on the _outside_ of containers, always increasing the total size of the container. An option to round the inner borders, cropping the container content itself is planned.

+## Blur
+It would be nice to add bluring of semi-transparent windows since it's hard to use them with more complex backgrounds. This has quite a few nuances and may even require a custom wlroots build, we'll see.
