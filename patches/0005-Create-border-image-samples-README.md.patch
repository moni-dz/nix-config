+# Border Image Samples
+This folder contains sample border images for anyone's use. A `testing` folder also provides border images which can be used for easier debugging of incorrect border image rendering.
+
+Feel free to add your own and make a PR, as long as they aren't _too_ similar to existing samples. Please include a sample image and keep the list in alphabetical order.
